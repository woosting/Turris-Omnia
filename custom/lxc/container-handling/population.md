# Populate the container

1. Populate the container with basic tooling and create a regular user:

	```
	cimport -c <containername> -u <username>
	```

    > NOTE: In case you do not have the script yet:
	>
    > 1. Download the script (create the target directory if required):
	>
	>		```
	>		$ git clone https://github.com/woosting/cimports.git /srv/scripts/cimports
	>		```
	> 4. Make the script executable:
	>		```
	>		$ chmod 755 /srv/scripts/cimports/cimport.sh
	>		```
    > 3. Place a symbolic link in the path to make it available from any location:
	>		```
	>		# ln -s /srv/scripts/cimports/cimport.sh /usr/bin/cimport
	>		```

2. Grab a cup of coffee...
